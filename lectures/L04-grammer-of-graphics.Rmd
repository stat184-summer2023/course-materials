## Grammar of Graphics

- Wilkinson's 2005 book *The Grammer of Graphics (2nd Ed.)* provides the principles and philosophy 
    - the `ggplot2` R package implements this framework
    - **Goal**: flexible tools for building rich, intuitive graphics

- Data Visualization is critical to our goals for high quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    1. **Examine the data source:** variable types, coding, missingness, summary statistics/plots, who/what/when/where/why/how data were collected
    2. **Discover features that influence may modeling decisions:** investigate potential outliers, consideration for recoding variables (e.g., numeric data that's functionally dichotomous), evaluate correlation structure (e.g., autocorrelation, hierarchy, spatial/temporal proximity)
    3. **Address research questions:** build intuition and note preliminary observations/conclusions related to each research question.  Also, note observations that prompt you to refine your research questions or add new questions to investigate

## Glyphs and Data

In archaeology, a GLYPH is a symbol or "mark" used to impart meaning:

HeiroGLYPH | Mayan GLYPH
---------------|----------------:
![Heiroglyph](images/hand.jpg) | ![Mayan glyph](images/mayan-glyph.png) 

## Data Glyph


### A data glyph is also a "mark" on a graph, e.g. 

![](images/geom_rect.png) ![](images/geom_segment.png) ![](images/geom_text.png) ![](images/geom_crossbar.png) ![](images/geom_path.png) ![](images/geom_line.png) ![](images/geom_pointrange.png) ![](images/geom_ribbon.png) ![](images/geom_point.png) ![](images/geom_polygon.png) ![](images/geom_histogram.png) ![](images/geom_dotplot.png) ![](images/geom_freqpoly.png) ![](images/geom_density.png) ![](images/geom_violin.png) 

The features of a data glyph encodes the value of variables. 

- Some are very simple, e.g. a dot: ![](images/geom_point.png)
- Some combine different elements, e.g. a pointrange: ![](images/geom_pointrange.png)
- Some are complicated, e.g. a dotplot: ![](images/geom_dotplot.png)

See: *<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/>*


## Some Graphics Components

#### **glyph**

- The basic graphical unit often corresponding to one case.
- Other terms used include *mark* and *symbol*. 

#### **aesthetic**

- a visual property of a glyph such as position, size, shape, color, etc.  
- may be **mapped** based on data values: `sex -> color` 
- may be **set** to particular non-data related values: `color is black`

#### **scale**

* A mapping that translates data values into aesthetics.  For example,
* A scatter plot of health risks may identify cigarette smoking:  
    - <font color="blue">blue</font> represents "No"
    - <font color="red">red</font> represents "Yes"
- A printed map of campus uses a scaled representation of distance
    - a centimeter on the printed map represents 100 meters of distance on campus

#### **frame**

- The position scale describing how data are mapped to the coordinate system in use
- Quite often, the frame defines the x-axis and y-axis of a 2-dimensional cartesian plane


#### **guide**

* An indication for the human viewer of the scale.  This allows the viewer to translate aesthetics back into data values.
* For example, 
    - a legend makes explicit the meaning of Red & Blue points on the chart
    - a 1 cm length printed on a map to inform the reader that it corresponds to 100 meters on campus


Can you determine all the components on the following graph?

```{r}
#?mtcars
data("mtcars")

mtcars %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = hp, 
                 y = mpg, 
                 color = as.factor(carb), 
                 shape = as.factor(gear))) +
  facet_grid(~vs, 
             labeller = labeller(vs = c("0" = "V-Shaped", 
                                        "1" = "Straight"))) +
  ggtitle("Example Plot from `mtcars` Data") + 
  xlab("Gross Horsepower") + 
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Number of Forward Gears") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Number of Carburetors")

```

## An Example 

```{r, warning = F}
library(dcData)
library(tidyverse)
dat <- NCHS %>%
  dplyr::select(sex, age, smoker, bpd, weight) %>%
  na.omit()

head(dat)

dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bpd, y = weight, color = smoker, shape = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap( ~ sex)
```



## Scales

#### The relationship between the variable value and the value of the aesthetic the variable is mapped to.

* Diastolic Blood Pressure (bpd) has units of mmHg (millimeters of mercury)
* Weight is measured in kg

The conversion from SBP to position is a *scale*.

* Smoker is "never", "former", "current"
* Color is red, green, blue, ...

The conversion from Smoker to color is a *scale*.



## Guides

#### Guide: an indication to a human viewer of what the scale is.

* Axis ticks and numbers

![](images/x-axis-scale.png)

* Legends

![](images/color-scale.png) 
![](images/shape-scale.png) 


* Labels on faceted graphics

![](images/facet-scale.png)

## Facets 

 * (x,y) is determined by `Time` and `weight`
 * basically a separate frame for each `Diet`
 * uses same x and y on each facet 
 

```{r}
#?ChickWeight
data("ChickWeight")

ChickWeight %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point()+ 
  facet_grid( ~ Diet)

```



## Designing Graphics

Graphics are designed by the human expert (you!) in order to reveal information that's present in the data.

#### Design choices


* What kind of glyph, e.g. scatter, density, bar, ... many others
* What variables constitute the frame. And some details:
    - axis limits
    - logarithmic axes, etc.
* What variables should be mapped to other aesthetics of the glyph.
* Whether to facet and with what variable.

More details, ..., e.g. setting of aesthetics to constants


## Good and Bad Graphics

Remember ... 

> Graphics are designed by the human expert (you!) in order to reveal information that's present in the data.

- choices depend on what information you want to convey.
- practice reading graphics and critique which ways of arranging thing are better or worse.
- A basic principle is that a graphic is about *comparison*.  Good graphics: 
    - make it easy for people to perceive things that are similar and things that are different.  
    - put the things to be compared in proximity to one another (e.g., "side-by-side") 




## Perception and Comparison

In roughly descending order of human ability to compare nearby objects:

1. Position
2. Length
3. Area
4. Angle
5. Shape (but only a very few different shapes)
6. Color

Color is the most difficult...    

  - color gradients --- we're better at
  - discrete colors --- must be carefully selected.
  - lots of people are color blind ([1 in 12 men; 1 in 200 women](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/))

## Glyph-Ready Data

Glyph-ready data has this form:

  * There is one row for each glyph to be drawn. 
  * The variables in that row are mapped to aesthetics of the glyph (including position)
  * Glyph-ready data is often, but not not always, tidy data. But `tidyverse` makes it is very easy to go between the two!


<div class="columns-2">
**Glyph-ready data**
```{r echo=FALSE}
data("iris")
head(iris)
```

**Mapping of data to aesthetics**

```
Sepal.Length -> x position      
Petal.Length -> y position    
Species -> color
```

Scales determine details of translation from

`variable -> aesthetic` 

```{r include=FALSE}
iris.glyphready <- iris %>%
  rename(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)
head(iris.glyphready)
```
</div>

<!--
It's as if the variables were given the name of the aesthetic.
-->



## Layers -- building up complex plots 

Each layer may have its own data, glyphs, aesthetic mapping, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris , aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, colour = as.factor(Species))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

 * one layer has points
 * another layer has the curves

## Stats: Data Transformations

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris , aes(x = Petal.Width)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15) 
```

  * What are the glyphs, aesthetics, guides, etc. for this plot?
  * How is the data for this plot related to the "raw" data?
  


## Path to success

 1. **Eye-training** 
 
    - recognize and describe glyphs, aesthetics, scales, etc.
    - identify data required for a plot
    
 2. **Data wrangling** 
 
    - get data into glyph-ready format (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`)
    - (we'll start doing this next week!)
    
 3. **Graphics construction** 
    
    - Newbies: match variables to aesthetics **interactively**: 
        - `esquisse` package using `esquisser( )`  
        - `mosaic` package using `mplot( )` 
        - BOTH generate `ggplot2` syntax 
    - Pros: learn to write `ggplot2` code directly


<!--  - `DataComputing` package using `scatterGraphHelper( )`, `barGraphHelper( )`, `densityGraphHelper( )` -->


## The Big Mac Index

<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-12-22>

```{r message=FALSE}
# These data are available from the `tidytuesdayR` package 
# Install package from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

library(tidytuesdayR)

TidyTuesData <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 52)
BigMac <- TidyTuesData[["big-mac"]]

```


## Big Mac Price vs GPD per Capita?

Let's use the `esquisse` package to explore the data!

In the console: 

`esquisser(BigMac)`

Or you can use the `mplot(BigMac)` function from the `mosaic` package. 


```{r}
library(esquisse)

# use `esquisser( )` to draft a plot and then generate R code to put here!

```


### Here's an example:

```{r}
ggplot(BigMac) +
 aes(x = gdp_dollar, y = dollar_price) +
 geom_point(size = 1L, colour = "#0c4c8a") +
 labs(title = "Big Mac Price Around the World vs GDP per Capita") +
 theme_minimal()
```

- Using the graph, what can you say about the following?
  - Frame  
  - Glyph
  - Aesthetic
  - Scale
  - Guide
  - Facet


## Value of Big Mac around the world

```{r}
# using `mWorldMap( )` from `mosaic` package
library(mosaic)

# `key` argument takes the ID variable; `fill` takes the measured variable 
mWorldMap(BigMac, key = "iso_a3", fill = "dollar_price")
```
