## Tidyverse

![](images/tidyverse.png)


## What is the Tidyverse? 

- The `tidyverse` package contains the packages, 
  - `dplyr` - provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges
  - `ggplot2` - system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics
  - `readr` - readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf).
  - `tidyr` - provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data
  - `purrr` - purrr enhances Râ€™s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors
  - `forcats` - provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors
  - `stringr` - provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible
  - `tibble` - a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not.
- The "tidyverse" is a consistent framework for storing, importing, wrangling, modeling, and visualizing data. 


- Managed by Rstudio (the company), now called Posit 
  - Code largely written by Hadley Wickham 
- In this class we will mostly be using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, and `readr`
  - we will use basic `stringr` near the end of the class 

- You don't need to know all the functions the tidyverse! We will be learning useful ones throughout the course.

## The pipe 

One operator that exists in the tidyverse that we will be using throughout this class is the pipe: `%>%`. 

- When you load `library(tidyverse)`, a new operator called the "pipe",  `%>%`, becomes available for you to use. 
- We use the pipe to form long chains of code. 

### The basics

- `x %>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)`
- `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
- `x %>% f() %>% g() %>% h()` is equivalent to `h(g(f(x)))`

### Small Example

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
x <- 1:10

#the following are equivalent 
mean(x)
x %>% mean()
```


### Example of long chains of code using %>%
```{r}
# look at the data 
head(iris)

# find the mean and sd of petal widths by species type
iris %>%
  select(Species, Petal.Width) %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(mu = mean(Petal.Width),
            sigma = sd(Petal.Width))

```

### Help 

If you ever want to look at the help file for `%>%` run one of the following: 

```{r, eval = F}
?`%>%`
help(`%>%`)
```

Note the \` symbol around the `%>%`. It is the accent symbol (located on the key left of the 1 key). It is not a quotation mark. This is a quotation mark: \'. 


Aside: `%>%` actually lives in the `magittr` package, which is also technically in the tidyverse, but lives in the "back-end" technical stuff. Learning exactly where `%>%` lives in the tidyverse is beyond this class. If you're interested in learning more, let me know!



## Thematic Statement 


> Almost everyone who writes computer commands starts by copying and modifying existing commands. 

> To do this, you need to be able to **read** command expressions.  

> Once you can read, you will know enough to identify the patterns you need for any given task and consider what needs to be modified to suit your particular purpose.




## R Command Patterns in the Tidyverse: Command Chains


- Each link in the chain will be a data verb and its arguments.
    - The very first link is usually a data table.
    - Put each link on its own line in general
    
- Links are connected by the pipe: `%>%` 

- Often, but not always, you will save the output of the chain in a named object.
    - This is done with the *assignment operator*, `<-`

- Note that `%>%` is at the end of each line.
    - Except ... `Princes <-` is assignment
    - Except ... The last line has no `%>%`.
    

**We'll be using the chain syntax for most things in STAT 184**.  You should know that anything written with chain syntax can be written without, and lots of things written without can be converted to chain syntax. Chain syntax is not a requirement in R code, it is just the easiest, most concise place to start.       


```{r}
#remember we already loaded in tidyverse library
dat.football <- read_tsv( "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ada-lovecraft/ProcessingSketches/master/Bits%20and%20Pieces/Football_Stuff/data/nfl-salaries.tsv")

head(dat.football)

# What is the total salary by team?
dat.football %>%
  group_by(Team)%>% 
  summarize(PaidRoster = sum(Salary)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(PaidRoster))
```


## Parts of Speech in R

1. Data frames
    - tidy data for one or more variables 
    - Data frames often appear at the start of a command chain.
    - If assignment is used to save the result, the object created is usually a data frame. 
    - Convention: data table names should start with a CAPITAL LETTER, e.g., `RegisteredVoters` 

2. Functions
    - Functions are objects (i.e. *data verbs*) that transform an input into an output.
    - Functions are **always** followed by parentheses, that is, an opening  `(` and, eventually, a closing `)`.
    - Each link in a command chain starts with a function.

3. Arguments
    - Arguments describe the details of what a function is to do. 
    - They go **inside** a function's parentheses e.g. `function_name(arguments)`.  
    - Multiple arguments are **always** separated by commas e.g. `function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3)`.
    - Many functions take *named arguments* which look like a name followed by an `=` sign, e.g. `rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 3)`
    - Technical note: the data frame passed by `%>%` is by default used as the first argument to the function that immediately follows. e.g. `5 %>% rnorm(mean = 0, sd =3)` is equivalent to the previous example.


4. Variables
    - Variables are the components (columns) of tidy data tables.
    - When they are used, they usually appear in function arguments, that is, between the function's parentheses.
    - Variables will **never** be followed by `(`.
    - Convention: Variables should have names that start with a lower-case letter, they should **never** have spaces or "-", they should never start with a number (*not* universally followed).

5. Constants
    - Constants are single values, most commonly a number or a character string. 
    - Character strings will always be in quotation marks,     
       `"like this."`  
    - Numerals are the written form of numbers, for instance.    
        `-42`  
        `1984`  
        `3.14159`  

### Additional Remarks

6. Assignment
    - stores the output of the command (chain) in a named object.
    - Use the *assignment operator*, `<-` (it looks like an arrow pointing to the object) 

7. Formulas
    - common argument to many functions
    - `regressionModel <- lm(Y ~ X, data = ProjectData)`
        - The `Y ~ X` part is a formula
        - What other parts do you see?
    - mostly left to other statistics classes  


## Discussion Problem

Consider this command chain:
```{r eval=FALSE}
Princes <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl("Prince", name)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

Just from the syntax, you should be able to discern the role of each of these things: 

- `Princes` 
- `BabyNames` 
- `filter` 
- `grepl` 
- `"Prince"` 
- `name` 
- `group_by` 
- `year` 
- `summarise` 
- `total` 
- `sum` 
- `count`

Options: Data Frame, function, argument, variable, constant, assignment operator, formula
